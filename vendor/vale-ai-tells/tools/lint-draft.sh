# lint-draft — run every prose gate over one drafted document, in a
# single call, and report all of it at once.
#
# The recipes this replaces each run one checker over many files.
# `mise run lint-prose x.md` runs vale and says nothing about spelling or
# structure, so a document that clears it can still fail cspell and
# rumdl afterwards. Answering them one at a time is how a twenty-line
# file turns into four rounds. Every gate reports here, whatever the
# ones before it found.
#
# The probe is the other half. Vale matches a path against the sections
# in .vale.ini, the match is exact, and a path no section binds styles to
# loads no styles at all. Vale then reads the file, applies nothing,
# prints nothing, and exits 0, which is byte for byte what a clean
# document produces. Measured in this repository: one paragraph of
# deliberately bad prose draws 9 findings as TODO.md and as
# docs/deep/nested.md, and zero as notes.txt, zero under styles/, zero
# under tmp/, and zero under .claude/skills/. The last three do match a
# section, but one that sets `BasedOnStyles =` on purpose, which reaches
# the reader the same way an unmatched path does.
#
# So this sends known-bad text through vale under the target's own path,
# using --path to associate that path with stdin, and never touching the
# file. Findings mean the path carries rules. Silence from text this bad
# means the path carries none, and the clean run above proved nothing.
#
# Findings print in the shape the ai-tells-agent template uses, and the
# exit code carries the result.
#
# Usage: lint-draft.sh <file>
